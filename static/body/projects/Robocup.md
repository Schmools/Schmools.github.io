###Robocup Jr. Soccer

Robocup Jr. Soccer is a competition I competed in for three years at the end of middle school and the beginning of high school.  I built 22cm diameter robots to play soccer autonomously. When I started this competition, I did not know any CAD or circuit design software.  Through working on this project and iterating through designs, I learned Autocad and kiCad and then Eagle and Inventor. This project has gone through many iterations, some photos of which are attached above. The project was an opportunity for me to experiment with different techniques and technologies (LIDAR, ROS, and high powered brushless drives to name a few) and is the project I probably learned the most from. Though I don't have any photos of them, one of the things I iterated on in this competition was a set of custom omni wheels I designed. It was very difficult to develop wheels that were compact, durable, and grippy enough to perform well for extended periods of time.

Following are some images of some of the iterations my robots went through over the years:
