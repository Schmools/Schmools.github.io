<h3>Origami</h3>
<p>At the beginning of quarantine, I watched all the lectures in a math class Iâ€™ve always wanted to take on computational geometry, "Geometric Folding Algorithms: Linkages, Origami, Polyhedra." As part of this course I watched a lecture on art and design in origami where the beautiful works of Robert Lang and Jason Ku were featured. It was this lecture which inspired me to come back to Origami. Origami is a lot of fun for me as it connects my interests in math and design, with the joy I get from physically making thing. Following are some objects I've folded.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Hyperbolic Paraboloid</strong></p>
<p><img src="/static/img/Samuel Schuur Origami Composite.jpg" width="600"/>
<img src="/static/img/moreHypar.jpg" width="600"/></p>
<p>This is an example of a hyperbolic paraboloid that I folded after pre-creasing the fold pattern with a laser cutter, to experiment with various methods for pre-creasing for my independent study project, for which I am making a dedicated CNC tool for pre-creasing origami. Of the mathematical constructs I fold, I think the hyperbolic paraboloid is the coolest. It was originally developed as a Bauhaus design exercise in 20's, it approximates the mathematical function for a hyperbolic paraboloid incredibly closely, and multiple paraboloids can be assembled to form various stellated platonic solids. It's also one of the simplest examples of single collapse origami, and despite having a simple crease pattern of concentric rings it forms a complex result.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Cricket</strong></p>
<p><img src="/static/img/crickt.jpg" width="600"/></p>
<p>This is a very small Origami cricket I folded, so small in fact that I had to fold most of it with a pair of tweezers. It's particularly meaningful to me because it was one of the first complex pieces of origami I made. Like many of the insects I fold, it took me multiple attempts and several hours to get this piece of origami to a state where I was happy with it. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Dragon v3</strong></p>
<p><img src="/static/img/Samuel-Schuur-Dragon.jpg" width="600"/></p>
<p>This is my first attempt at folding an origami dragon designed by Jo Nakashima. At the end of my precalculus course last year, for a final project, I watched the class "Geometric Folding Algorithms: Linkages, Origami, Polyhedra" and wrote a presentation on the beginning of it (which can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/Schmools/foldingLesson/blob/master/README.md">https://github.com/Schmools/foldingLesson/blob/master/README.md</a>). I worked hard on that project and class and wanted to give my teacher, Mr. Worrall, an origami that I had folded as a tangible product of my work. Since we were in lockdown I couldnâ€™t do that last spring. Instead, I folded and gave him an origami dragon at the beginning of this school year. The picture shows a prototype fold. The dragon was quite challenging because it was so small and the decorative paper I was folding on was so soft. I folded it with tweezers and lots of very small binder clips.</p>

<p><strong>Stellated Ocathedra</strong></p>
