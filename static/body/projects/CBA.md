###The MIT Center for Bits and Atoms

For the last two summers I've worked at the CBA as part of the machines
that make project ([mtm.cba.mit.edu](https://mtm.cba.mit.edu)) alongside
graduate students from many backgrounds from many backgrounds
(architecture, math, and biology to name a few).

The summer of 2020, I worked on developing and testing a modular CNC kit
designed to make it easy to teach a CNC class the CBA offers remotely.
I also worked on developing a custom 3D printer hotend for that kit.

My first summer (2019) interning at the MIT Center for Bits and Atoms,
I worked on developing a modular kinematic mount based tool changer for
a gantry based CNC table I was working on testing and upgrading. This
project was quite difficult. I went through three different CAD iterations
in order to get the preload correct for the stiffnesses of the materials
I was using, as well as fine tuning the cam and bowden systems. This
project was fun because it was the first independent work I did as an
intern, and I learned to use many tools in order to complete it. For
example, I ran the waterjet for myself for the first time during this
project. I also had to consider not only the optimal release mechanism,
but also material stiffness (Hertzian deflections, mostly), the Maxwell
criterion for kinematic mounts, and the capstan equation, among other
elements of tool design. The project was very fulfilling because modeling
tool changers was one of the reasons I was hired for the internship. You
