###FRC

I've been a member of my schools FRC team, team 5806 for the past four years (since the 2018 season). I've been CAD/CAM lead for the past three years, and head of DBT (Design, Build, Test; essentially the mechanical subteam) for the past two. I also make our teams reveal video each year.

**FRC 2020: Infinite Recharge**

In 2020, I became head of DBT (Design, Build, Test) and was in charge of every mechanical aspect of our robot. Not only did I have to CAD our entire robot from various subteams designs, but I also had to manage those subteams and make sure they were all on track and designing assemblies that would integrate well together. In 2020, our team built the most complicated robot that I have worked on. I was the lead designer of the intake, indexer, and flywheel shooter, and was responsible for the machining of the robot. To save weight I designed two isogrid plates for mounting the electronics. These plates were the most challenging parts I manufactured. I also had a lot of fun designing and machining the semi-custom drive gearboxes pictured above. Even though our season was cut short due to Covid-19 and we didn't quite get to finish the robot, I am incredibly proud of all the work I put into it.

**FRC 2019: Deep Space**

In 2019 I became the CAD/CAM specialist for my FRC team, 5806. This meant I got to CAD and design, or at least be heavily involved in the design of almost, every single part of the robot. This year we decided to make a specialist robot scoring cargo and hatches on both the lowest level of the rocket and cargo ship. Our robot has a 6 mini cim drivetrain, and uses pneumatics for pretty much everything. As a result, I spent quite a bit of time designing piston geometry. The fact that we were attempting to do an almost 180 degree flip using pistons made it quite difficult. I experimented with pistons of many bore sizes and throws, calculating the force and torque for them each time before we finally arrived at a good combination. I was also responsible for the CNC'ing of our drive rails and frame members, as well billet parts that interfaced with our waterjet belly pan. Additionally I worked on the second iteration of our hatch intake, pneumatically actuated and made from aluminum and delrin (my favorite!).

**FRC 2018: Power Up**

2018 was my first year on my school's FRC team, my robotics extracurrical of choice. In 2018 we decided to build a low specialist robot to primarily deal with the switch and vault game elements. Theoretically we could also shoot for the scale. Since one of our seniors could weld, we built a primarily welded, very dense and tightly packaged robot which we named Nessie. Nessie had an arm for manipulating power cubes that was tilted using two linear actuators. It also had a set of shifting gearboxes and a climbing hook system that we had to cut due to weight issues. Steel robots are heavy. It was a pretty cool robot, unfortunately it had a few issues including problems with the potentiometers on the linear actuators and a tendancy to bend pistons on the intake, but when it worked it did its job well (check out NYC Q4 Match 1 for a good example, [https://www.thebluealliance.com/match/2018nyny_qf4m1](https://www.thebluealliance.com/match/2018nyny_qf4m1)). As a freshman with knowledge of CAD, I was involved in drivetrain and superstructure packaging. I also took on a project of my own, our climb hook! I designed, FEA'd, and built a delrin and 3D printed collapsing hook to allow our 118lb robot to climb. Since we were so close to the weight limit, the design was particularly challenging because it had to weigh less than two pounds.

**Cadathons**

I also participate in FRC related Cadathons from time to time; here are a few favorite things I've designed.
