Hi, I'm Samuel Schuur, I'm currently on a gap year working in Berkeley, CA. I have
a mild obsession with pretty much everything with any relation to
engineering, robotics, and CNCs. I fold origami. I also play the violin.

**Heres a list of some things I like and/or find interesting:**

- CAD and CAM
- Neovim (I'm also partial to Doom Emacs (because org-mode!))
- reading
- backpacking
- computational geometry
- complicated linkages
- monty python
- filmmaking (I make a good DP but a bad director)
- submarines
- ginger products
- nice pencils
- bouldering
- origami
- the history of random things
- typography
- sterning (a canoe)
- baroque music
- sea planes (flying boats)
- old maps, also map projections
- industrial design (also the MoMA wing of the same name)
- libraries
- architecture
- building scale model WWI planes out of legos
- PCBs
- RC Airplanes
- ROS
- the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy
- the UK
- celtic music
- brutalist architecture
- Breuer's cape cod houses
- xkcd
- manhole covers
- physics
- babbage engines
- rockets
- graphic design

*This list is one of the few things that I like enough that it stuck
around from my old site. You can see that at this archived (I'm a strong believer in, and user of the Internet Archive) link:

I currently attend the University of Chicago with an intended major in maths. 
Previously I was at the Horace Mann School and took AP Calculus BCH,
Organic Chemistry, Global Environmental History, an English Elective on
Kafka, Software Engineering, Recording Studio Technology, and an
independent study developing CNC tools to produce origami crease patterns during my Senior Year.
Additionally I am currently watching three OCW courses, "MIT 6.849:
Geometric Folding Algorithms: Linkages, Origami, Polyhedra," "MIT 6.832:
Underactuated Robotics," and "MIT 18.06" (as well as a bit of 18.065) as
well as being tutored in AP/College level physics and working through the
problem sets of an HM class I didn't get to take this year; Math Seminar.
