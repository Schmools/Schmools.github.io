			<h3>3D Printed Clock:</h3>
			At some point during the summer of 2017 I read the book Longitude, about how John Harrison solved the longitude problem by building a series of very accurate clocks, sea clocks, designed to be able to carried on boats such that they had accurate time references and so could determine their longitude. I very much enjoyed the book and so when I saw a 3d printing competition a little while later, I decided I wanted to design my own clock; after all if people could build very accurate clocks in the 18th century, it would surely be possible to make one with such a multitude of CNC fabrication tools as we have now.

		<p>As such I went about designing a clock to be 3d printed on an SLS machine in one part. It is certainly not as complex of a clock as Harrison's sea clocks were, but it was still a fun design project. I was especially happy with how the packaging worked out such that the weight was actually integrated into a ring that rotated around the entire movement and how the escapement managed to fit neatly alongside the geartrain. It was also good fun if a bit frustrating to iterate the escapement mechanism with lasercut parts.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately once I designed the part I had no real access to a SLS 3d printer to actually make it properly, a company in Poland ended up printing it and I think it turned out nicely, unfortunately their printer could not hold all of the tolerances I was using in the design and as such the pendulum seized up; regardless I think it turned out pretty cool. You can see more of the clock, including CAD, here: <a href="https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-print-in-one-piece-pendulum-clock-48839">https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-print-in-one-piece-pendulum-clock-48839</a>!</p>
