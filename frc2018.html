			<h3>FRC 5806: Power Up</h3>
			<p>2018 was my first year on my school's FRC team, my robotics extracurrical of choice. In 2018 we decided to build a low specialist robot to primarily deal with the switch and vault game elements. Theoretically we could also shoot for the scale. Since one of our seniors could weld, we built a primarily welded, very dense and tightly packaged robot which we named Nessie. Nessie had an arm for manipulating power cubes that was tilted using two linear actuators. It also had a set of shifting gearboxes and a climbing hook system that we had to cut due to weight issues. Steel robots are heavy. It was a pretty cool robot, unfortunately it had a few issues including problems with the potentiometers on the linear actuators and a tendancy to bend pistons on the intake, but when it worked it did its job well. I primarily worked on the drivetrain design. I also designed a climb hook using Delrin (the first part I properly FEA'd!) which worked though we never got to use it in competition. Here you can see our reveal video which I shot and edited, and a picture of my hook.</p>
