			<h3>Robocup Jr. Soccer:</h3>
			Robocup Jr. Soccer is a robotics competion that I have been involved with in some manner for the past three and a half years or so. It involves having small robots (22cm in diameter) to play soccer autonmously with a small passive orange ball. When I first started this competition I did not know any CAD or circuit design software, but through working on this project and iterating through designs I learned first Autocad and kiCad and then Eagle and Inventor. This project has gone through many iterations, honestly at this point it is more of a fun design challenge for me; I just end up designing and iterating these robots many times and never end up having time to properly code them (though in theory they were supposed to run ROS). In many ways this project has become a way for me to expirement with different techniques and technologies (LIDAR!) and just been a fun small project to mess around with. Here are some pictures of my iterations over the ages.
