###Pencils

I'm a big fan of pencils; in fact they are the only writing instruments I use (this is not entirely true I have one pen, but it lives in a special pocket in my bag). I prefer woodcase pencils but I make an exception for a couple mechanical pencils. This page (mostly for personal references documents the pencils I'm currently using and those I have yet to sharpen/use.

**Currently in my pencil case:**

With some fun 3d printed pencil caps I made!

**Stubs:**

Pencils to short to comfortably hold in my hand, alongside my hand sharpeners and pencil extender.
