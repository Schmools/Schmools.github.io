###Custom 3d Printer

For my internship at the MIT Center for Bits and Atoms this summer, I worked remotely and was expected to be able to manufacture parts for the projects I was working on. Since the lead time on ordering a 3D printer was so long, I decided to build a custom 3D printer based off of the Prusa Bear design. The printed parts were made out of SLS printed PA12 nylon and I sourced the rest of the parts, which was the most difficult part of the project. I'm very happy with how this printer works, but I'm also a big fan of the Voron 3D printer project, and have been working on designing modular custom hotends while interning. Perhaps in the future I will upgrade this printer to reflect that, allowing it to print with similar quality but much faster.
