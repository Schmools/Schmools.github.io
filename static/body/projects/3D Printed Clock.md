###3d Printed Clock

Inspired by reading Longitude, which tells the story of John Harrison and his "Sea Clocks," the first clocks accurate enough to calculate longitude from a boat, and memories of seeing escapements at the Franklin Institute, I made a pendulum clock designed to be printed in one piece on an SLS 3d printer. The clock would be driven by gravity via a brass weight that threaded into the large ring gear that encircles the clock. In order to design the clock's deadbeat escapement, I read several old books on clockmaking, the most useful being The Modern Clock, published in 1905. I prototyped several iterations of the escapement by laser cutting  (video of escapement working: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydga0vu-fp0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydga0vu-fp0)). One challenge was figuring out the tolerances of sliding fits. Since SLS prints are expensive, I first guessed this value by looking at the grain size of PA12 nylon powder and reading about fits in the Machinists Handbook. The parts fused, so I had to make another iteration.
